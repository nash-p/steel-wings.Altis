UNORGANIZED NOTES
-----------------------------

The genericSAM_Comp and genericSHORAD_Comp triggers are meant to be used to create Air defense site compositions.
Simply put the objects you want to be spawned in as a ADS site into the trigger area and they will be 'cached' as such. They will also be deleted from the map afterwards.
Currently working on a system to spawn custom ADS sites for some areas because the generic ones cant fit into less than 100x100mÂ² flat free area, which is not cool :(
